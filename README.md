# Just 3D

Just 3D is a personal challenge learn to implement PBR rendering as fast as I can and then optimize is as far as I can.

For now this will be a Windows application running in an OpenGL 4.6 context.

# ROADMAP

- [ ] Arena allocator coupled with virtual memory done the right way
- [ ] Defining a custom model binary file layout convering all the necessary data for basic PBR rendering (so updating my [gltf2custom](https://github.com/vegasword/gltf2custom) tool)
- [ ] Reading and loading as fast as I can this custom model file
- [ ] Implementing PBR by reading [this resource](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html)
- [ ] Implementing [Basis Universal texture](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal)
